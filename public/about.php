							Compario was created for all cricket lovers who love their cricket stats. There are a lot of sites that show stats for your favorite cricket players, howeve, none of them really have the ability to compare players in one go. 

							<br/><br/>

							During the Cricket World Cup 2019, when there was a lot of chatter around who plays better than who, this idea took shape to create a service that allows cricket fans to actually compare stats of their favorite cricket players head-to-head. Compario reveals some interesting stats which provide great insights to the performance of players.
